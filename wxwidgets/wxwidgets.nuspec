    <summary>Cross-Platform GUI Library</summary>
    <description>wxWidgets is a C++ library that lets developers create applications for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and other platforms with a single code base. It has popular language bindings for Python, Perl, Ruby and many other languages, and unlike other cross-platform toolkits, wxWidgets gives applications a truly native look and feel because it uses the platform's native API rather than emulating the GUI. It's also extensive, free, open-source and mature. </description>

	INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE SINCE 2.9.0

- wxStandardPaths doesn't use vendor name by default under MSW and OSX to
  remain compatible with 2.8 behaviour but this makes it incompatible with
  2.9.0. Please use UseAppInfo(AppInfo_AppName | AppInfo_VendorName) explicitly
  to use the vendor name in the paths returned by wxStandardPaths.

- wxDataViewModel::GetAttr() is now const, as it should have been from the very
  beginning. You will need to change it to be const in your derived model
  class too if you override it.
